QuantumGI(graph1,graph2)

For a vertex v in graph 1
and each vertex w in graph 2
And for adjencency matrix A1 for graph1 and A2 for graph2

We need to find ground states of matrixes Av = A1 + I -|v><v|, Aw = A2 + I - |w><w|
The ground states respectively are |s>, |t>

# Preperation of quantum system
adiabatic preperation of graph1 -> |s> # Note: that the adiabatic preperations might not need to be implemented as the paper states their time cost is negligible
adiabatic preperation of graph2 -> |t> #       hence an alternative might be to just use preprepared states

# Finding perumutations through altered Groves Search
Need to make a Unitary matrix to make an iterative operator Q such that
Q = U(I-2|s><s|)U+(I-2|t><t|)
With <s|U|t> != 0

Then perform Q, k = Pi/4 Sqrt(N) times in such manner
Q^k U |s> = |phi>

Check <t|phi> is approximately 1 else return up to

Test on each |v> in graph 1 and w in graph 2 if Q^k is a permutation matrix
This is at worst N^2 comparing all computational basis pairs

At worst case need to repeat this procedure for all |v> so N loops at worst case.
