# SimulatingQGI
The objective is to work towards developing a simulation of the Quantum graph Isomorphism Algorithm defined by Xi Li and Hanwu Chen (see reference 1). 

Currently this project will be using Qiskit as too simulate quantum circuits though this could change.
Other objectives include: 
- Comparisions between the algorithim and other methods previously outlined such as the adiabatic quantum system by Frank Giatan and Lane Clark (See reference 2)
- Running the simulator on backend hardware
- Transitions into other systems such as One-way Quantum computation to compare results to in each format
